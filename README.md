AI assistant for Autism treatment

The main issue of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are impairments in social interaction and communication, including failure to participate within groups, lack of awareness of others, indifference to affection or inappropriate affection, and a lack of social or emotional empathy, as well as both verbal and nonverbal abilities to share information with others.

Our customers are parents of children with autism aged from 4 to 12 or children themselves who have an economic burden to proper rehabilitation. Emoti provides our customers with communication practice, helping rehabilitate their social interaction and communication impairments in a cost-efficient way. Emotiâ€™s primary purpose is to support these children with autism as they progress toward their goal of being able to communicate or simply converse with those around them in a natural, fluent manner. By giving them a virtual assistant that can speak and act like a human, while independently becoming a figure that the patient can talk to without stress or discomfort, the patient can practice having a conversation without being in person. Our goal is to provide a new way for people with autism to learn how to speak and act like other people, and ultimately overcome autism.
